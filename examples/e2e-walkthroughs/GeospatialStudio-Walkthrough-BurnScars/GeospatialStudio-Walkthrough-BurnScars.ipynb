We can achieve this using an AI model which ingests satellite data (in this instance the NASA Harmonized Landsat Sentinel2 dataset) and outputs a map of burned area.  We could potentially then integrate the burned area extent with details of infrastructure or assets to quantify impact.\n",

For the data specification, you need to define the data collection and bands from sentinelhub (using the collection and band names for SH).  In addition, if the data to be fed in is returned from SH with a scale factor that needs to be added here too.

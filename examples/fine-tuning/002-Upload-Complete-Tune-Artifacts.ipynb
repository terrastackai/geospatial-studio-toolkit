    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you through the complete workflow of deploying a fine-tuned TerraTorch model to the GeoStudio platform. The process involves three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preparation**: Setting up checkpoint and configuration files from your fine-tuned TerraTorch model\n",
    "- **Upload Process**: Utilizing the GeoStudio SDK to transfer your model artifacts to the GeoStudio cloud infrastructure.\n",
    "- **Inference**: Running geospatial inference tasks using your uploaded model/tune.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding with this notebook, ensure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Active GeoStudio Service Access: Valid credentials and permissions for the GeoStudio inference service\n",
    "- SDK Installation: The GeoStudio SDK installed in your environment\n",
    "- Authentication Setup: API keys configured (either via environment variables or key files)\n",
    "- Model Artifacts: A completed fine-tuned TerraTorch model with both checkpoint (.ckpt) and configuration (.yaml) files\n",
    "- Cloud Storage Access: Valid credentials for your object storage bucket (AWS S3, IBM Cloud Object Storage, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** This workflow assumes you have already completed the model training process and possess both the trained checkpoint file and its corresponding configuration file. If you need guidance on fine-tuning TerraTorch models, refer to the TerraTorch documentation first.\n"

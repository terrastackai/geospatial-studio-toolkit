# Contributing

Welcome to GEOStudio Toolkit! This repository includes two main components:

- **[Python SDK](./geospatial-studio-sdk/README.md)** – the core toolkit for interacting with the platform programmatically.

- **[QGIS Plugin](./geospatial-studio-qgis/README.md)** – a UI extension for running and visualizing inferences directly inside QGIS.

If you are interested in contributing to the [GEOStudio Toolkit code repo](README.md), then please review the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Each component has its own getting started guide. Use the appropriate one for the part of the toolkit you want to work on:

- **[Python SDK Getting Started](./geospatial-studio-sdk/CONTRIBUTING.md)**
- **[QGIS Plugin Getting Started](./geospatial-studio-qgis/README.md)**

It's encouraged that you look under the [Issues](https://github.com/terrastackai/geospatial-studio-core/issues) tab for contribution opportunities.
